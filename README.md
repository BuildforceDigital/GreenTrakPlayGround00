Notice:
>When Oracle donated the JavaEE project to the Eclipse foundation, they maintained the copyright to the javax.* namespace. Subsequently, future versions of JavaEE, now called JakartaEE, would be required to use a new namespace for those packages. Instead of an incremental process, the Eclipse foundation opted for a big bang approach and packages formerly under the javax.* namespace has been refactored under the new jakarta.* namespace.
